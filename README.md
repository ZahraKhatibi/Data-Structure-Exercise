# Median Finder with AVL Tree

This C++ program implements a median finder using an AVL tree data structure. It allows you to efficiently find the median of a sequence of integers as they are inserted one by one.

## Overview

This program reads integers from the standard input and inserts them into an AVL tree. As each integer is inserted, it calculates and maintains the median of the integers seen so far. The median calculation is based on the AVL tree's ability to efficiently find the element at a specified rank (position) in logarithmic time.

## Features

- Efficient insertion of integers into an AVL tree.
- Real-time median calculation as integers are inserted.
- Support for both odd and even-length sequences of integers.
